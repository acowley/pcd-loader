Library for loading [PCD (Point Cloud
Data)](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php)
files.

An executable,`pcd2bin`, for converting ASCII formatted PCD files of
single-precision floating point 3D points to binary PCD format is
supplied. This can be useful as binary files are much faster to load.
